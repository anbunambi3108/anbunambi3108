# Hi, I'm Anbu

I build systems from data cleaning to business insights.

Most data projects fail because the foundation is weak. Poor data preparation and feature engineering create problems that no model can fix. I focus on cleaning data thoroughly, engineering features that matter, and building automated systems that scale.

## What I do
- Clean and prepare data at scale
- Engineer features that capture meaningful patterns
- Build automated pipelines that remain reliable
- Train models for prediction, segmentation, and forecasting
- Create visualizations and analysis for business decisions

## What I use
- Python for data processing and automation
- SQL for data extraction and organization
- Databricks for large-scale data work
- Statistical modeling and machine learning
- Data visualization and reporting

## Skills
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost), Clustering, Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet), Feature Engineering
Data Engineering: PySpark, ETL pipelines, Databricks, Data Warehousing
Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
