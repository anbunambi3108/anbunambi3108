# Hi, I'm Anbu

I build customer analytics systems from data cleaning to business insights.

Most data projects fail because the foundation is weak. Poor data preparation and feature engineering create problems that no model can fix. I focus on doing this work properly—cleaning data thoroughly, engineering features that matter, and building automated systems that scale.

I own the entire process: preparing customer data, building automated pipelines, training models for prediction and segmentation, and delivering analysis that informs business decisions.

## What I do
- Clean and prepare customer data at scale
- Engineer features that capture meaningful patterns
- Build automated pipelines that remain reliable
- Train models for prediction, segmentation, and forecasting
- Create visualizations and analysis for business decisions

## What I use
- Python for data processing and automation
- SQL for data extraction and organization
- Databricks for large-scale data work
- Statistical modeling and machine learning
- Data visualization and reporting

## My approach
Get the data and features right first. The quality of preparation and feature engineering directly determines whether your models work and whether your insights are actionable.
