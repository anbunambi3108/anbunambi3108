## Hi, I'm Anbu
I build customer analytics systems from data preparation to business insights.
Poor data preparation and feature engineering create bottlenecks that downstream models struggle to overcome. I focus on cleaning data thoroughly, engineering features that matter, and building automated systems that scale.

### What I do
- Clean and prepare customer data—improving accuracy by ~80%, reducing processing time by ~90%
- Engineer features that capture meaningful customer behavior patterns
- Build automated pipelines for reliable data processing
- Train Random Forest and XGBoost models for churn prediction and segmentation achieving ~81% accuracy
- Deliver analysis that informs business decisions

### Impact
- Reduced customer churn by improving prediction accuracy and enabling retention-focused interventions through data-driven insights.

### Skills
   - **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL
   - **ML/Data:** Regression, Classification, Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA, Prophet, Feature Engineering
   - **Engineering:** PySpark, ETL pipelines, Databricks, Data Warehousing
   - **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
