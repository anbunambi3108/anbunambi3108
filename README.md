## Hi, I'm Anbu 👋

I build data systems that solve real business problems. The foundation matters most. I focus on data quality, feature engineering, and systems that scale because weak preparation will always limit what downstream work can achieve.

I work across the full pipeline: from raw data through analysis, modeling, and insights. I look for patterns that surface what matters most. This applies across any domain or industry.

I'm currently exploring how language models can make analytics findings clearer and more actionable for teams, without losing the rigor that drives real decisions. 🤖
